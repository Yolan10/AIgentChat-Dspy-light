# Usage

This project demonstrates a simplified multi-agent research system. Once the dependencies are installed and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is exported, you can run the simulation or launch the dashboard.

## Running the analysis simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will generate a population of agents and simulate conversations with them using the integrated agent framework.

## Starting the (experimental) dashboard

```bash
python main.py --dashboard
```

This will start a minimal Flask application that serves a placeholder page at the root URL.
