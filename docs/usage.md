# Usage

This project demonstrates a simplified multi-agent research system. Once the dependencies are installed and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is exported, you can run the simulation or launch the dashboard.

## Running the analysis simulation

```bash
python -m scripts.main
```

The system will generate a population of agents and simulate conversations with them using the integrated agent framework.

## Starting the (experimental) dashboard

```bash
python -m scripts.main --dashboard
```

The dashboard is currently a placeholder and will simply print a message that it is not yet implemented.
